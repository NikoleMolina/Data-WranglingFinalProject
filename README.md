## General Information
- Using R programming, the purpose of this project was to find which features best predicted song popularity by taking information from the top 2000 Spotify songs data. 
- This information was intended to show which features will help their songs reach top charts.

## Data Used
- [Spotify All Time Top 2000s Mega Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsumat/spotify-top-2000s-mega-dataset) 
- Spotify API
- Final data is a combination of both datasets resulting in a dataset of 148 rows and 17 columns

## Analysis Methods
- Summary Statistics
- Hypothesis Testings
- Fitting Models
- Visualizations

## Room for Improvement
- We could have scraped a bigger dataset.

## What I Learned
- How to use an API to scrape data
- Intergration of datasets
- Creating summary tables with dplyr
